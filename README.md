# Tic Tac Toe on Steroids!
###### Version 0.5

### Brief
Create a Tic Tac Toe game in Javascript.

### My Version
I wanted to create an extended version of Tic Tac Toe where the player could input a desired grid size. 20x20, 9x9 or 3x3 it's up to you!

Second functionality I've created is enabling the player to choose how many elements in a row are needed to win. This was not planned initially but it became a necessity as the grid size became open.

### Struggles
Most of the project time was spent on the game logic.
